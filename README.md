dub.snap
========

This project defines a snap package for DUB, a package and build manager
for the D programming language.

The D programming language is a systems programming language with C-like
syntax and static typing.  It combines efficiency, control and modelling
power with safety and programmer productivity.  For more information on
the D language, see: https://dlang.org/

Snap packages are designed to provide secure, containerized applications
that are appropriately sandboxed away from the rest of the system they
are running on.  For more information on snap packages, see:
